# webshop_project
This project I was made at the end of 2022. This is an online store of posters and merch, and it is already more complicated than the corgi_project, because after the content layout I connected it to CMS WordPress so that the admin had the opportunity to change the content on the website. In this project, the functionality written in JS is repeated, but nevertheless, this is already a multi-page site, where main pages are formed dynamically by substituting the header and footer, and it already works with PHP.

P.S All webdesign is made by myself as well!
